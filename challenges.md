# Challenges

Challenges are additional content for those who want to do even more in their game. They are divided into different topics to exercise other crucial skills for game development.

Challenges should only be attempted after teaching/learning the game prototype.

Allow yourself to try a challenge before seeking assistance or help. This is the time to practice what has been learned.

**Note to Teacher:** There is a difficulty gradient in each challenge, and some may require other challenges to be applied to the game. Evaluate the skill level of the students and give them appropriate challenges
